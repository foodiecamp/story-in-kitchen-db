/*description*/'Fruit, Vegetarian, Super Food Family Classics, Book',
/*difficulty*/2,
/*serving_amount*/4,
/*cooking_time*/35,
/*ingredient*/'1½ oz unsalted cashew nuts,2 tablespoons unsweetened desiccated coconut flakes,1 ripe pineapple,4 cardamom pods,1 cup all­ purpose whole­wheat flour,1¼ cups reduced ­fat (2%) milk,1 large free-range egg,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,1 pinch of ground cinnamon,olive oil,4 tablespoons plain yogurt,1 lime,optional: manuka honey',
/*direction*/'Toast the cashews in a large non­stick frying pan on a medium heat until lightly golden, add the coconut for just 30 seconds, then tip both into a pestle and mortar and lightly crush. Trim the ends off the pineapple, cut off the skin, quarter it lengthways, and cut away the core. Chop the flesh into ½­inch slices. Return the dry pan to a medium ­high heat and cook the pineapple for 5 to 10 minutes, or until caramelized, tossing regularly, then remove to a warm plate.Meanwhile, crush the cardamom pods, putting just the inner seeds into a blender with the flour, milk, egg, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and a tiny pinch of sea salt. Blitz until smooth. Drizzle a little oil into the empty pineapple pan, then carefully wipe it around and out with a ball of paper towel. Add just enough batter to lightly cover the base of the pan, cook until golden on both sides, then remove to a second plate. Repeat the process, stacking up the pancakes as you go and covering with a kitchen towel to keep warm.Either make up individual portions, or do a sharing platter for the middle of the table. Randomly tear, fold, and layer up the pancakes with the caramelized pineapple, spoonfuls of yogurt and sprinklings of crushed cashews and coconut. Repeat until you’ve used up all the ingredients, then finely grate over the lime zest. Nice served with a drizzle of honey, if you fancy.',
